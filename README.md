Although my pickup order was on-time and correct, the high GrubHub rating and positive reviews led me to anticipate much better food than I received. The pizza was just OK. Adequate cheese & topping quality/quantity. I have no idea why other reviews rave about the crust - it is nothing special. To be clear, the pizza wasn't gross. The garlic cheese bread was kinda gross, though: a toasted sesame seed hoagie bun with some kind of oil and a bit of mozz.",
